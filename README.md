# This repository contains Java projects and tasks I have done

These are some of my projects I have created on Java.
There are very basic console applications, as well as GUI applications consuming a REST API.

## Highlights

1. I have created a desktop GUI application using the Java Swing library, that consumes the API of the Fuel API project.
